# So that?

You're in a sprint planning, keeping the Agile gods happy with a user story:

> ~ As a user, I want to see all my accounts, so that...

So. that. So that? As with many things Agile, it can feel dumb because it has become routine. But, the idea is great: You'll build better software if you understand more about the problem. Software developers rush into solution mode way to early, you need to ask questions! It doesn't have to be "so that", and also not days of analysis. Just ask questions, ask the user, the product owner, teh business. Dead, simple, questions.
